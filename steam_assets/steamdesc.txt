[Server/Host mod]
Craft the Large Chest, or the Large Icebox. Or both!

Features:
- Large chest uses the "Ornate Chest" textures from Don't Starve, complete with animation. Thanks Klei!
- Large icebox uses the original icebox texture, scaled to 150%.
- 5x5 slots for both
- Recipe scaled to regular chest and icebox
	- chest = 3 boards -> 9 slots, large chest = 8 boards -> 25 slots, gold for balancing and decoration
	- icebox = 1 gear -> 9 slots, large chest = 3 gears -> 25 slots, other requirements are scaled accordingly
